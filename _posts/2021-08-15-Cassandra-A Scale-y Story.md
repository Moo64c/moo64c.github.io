## Whose Scale is This Anyway
A product's scale - size of service, supported traffic and distribution reach - changes over its life cycle. At first, a company will push out a product that works. Allowing a product to scale up nicely is not easy. Code cannot always be written to fit any scale and it cannot take precedence over getting a product out (or dealing with bugs). In the meantime the product might generate higher costs, run a bit slower and have less features in order to just get it out and sell it. It is always hard to know where to stop development - investing more development time means investing more money, but you usually get more out of it. Compromises are need to be made and developers always have to keep this in mind.

If it will be worth the trouble, somebody - sometime in the future - will take care of it.

## When Its Worth the Trouble
Our Database Administration (DBA) team was upset - every tiny configuration change in our product's cluster made their Cassandra database reach near catastrophe. New connections are dropped. Existing connections could not get a simple query through. From their metrics it was obvious how every time the application side restarts, the database cluster has to deal with hundreds of new connections simultaneously. Our product uses a few dozen application machines that create connections to the database cluster. One connection should be enough for every machine, right? Checking the logs, metrics and the code revealed that this expectation is not meant, and this was one problem that was not so critical before - every machine in the application cluster creates half a dozen or more connections.

Why?

When our machines start up, a central process creates and controls worker processes, and a "base" memory is shared from the central process. Every worker process under the central process keeps its memory insulated from the rest. Our application does not start database connections before this separation meaning each worker process needs to create its own connection. This allows us to use *thread-unsafe* libraries and code - we can not use them in a threaded environment since they keep an internal state, which might break if two workers will access it at the same time. This also forces *every* process to use its own database connection. A database connection consists of a socket connection per Cassandra node (Database Cluster machine) and an additional socket connection that controls it. There is also some caching being done. When you have enough application machines and enough Cassandra nodes, this means hundreds to a couple thousand connection start up at the same time if the application cluster restarts - for example, after a configuration change, which happens all the time. Cassandra was never meant to handle so much over in such a time bracket, so some new connections are not handled and dropped and many queries will not be handled until a some connection will complete. Even if the cluster was incrementally gaining machines, at some point the Cassandra side has to handle thousands of connections - to every database node - which leads to slowdowns.

## The Future is Now
When the connection schema was developed - it was not a real problem. It is an issue of **scale**. The effort needed to fix this then-non-issue just did not make sense when you have no more than 100-ish connections working against a small Cassandra cluster. Cassandra will handle this much traffic and more just fine. You will see some spikes in graphs when the application clusters are restarted, but nothing too bad. This is only an issue when the size of the clusters start to scale up.

In big-data business you cannot say it happened faster than anticipated because things scale up scarily fast.

A new customer appeared and the clusters needed to expand to fit the demand. After the clusters settled, DBAs were a bit nervous. After another customer and a bit more scaling up - DBAs made this a central concern for the development group. This "problem for somebody the future" became next week's problem pretty fast. A ticket is hastily created to minimize connections to the cluster, and future somebody was quickly selected.


## Dev Team Presents: Cassandra Communicator
Cassandra Communicator (abbreviated CC) was the solution we came up with.

Have too many connections? No problem. Let's just keep one in a separate process. Local machine sockets are cheap, fast, reliable and easy to run. Have every worker open a socket that handles all its Cassandra needs in one stop-shop. Use a simple protocol and send JSON-formatted instructions, and viola! you got support for any language that can open a local socket. All this - and more - in just one thread and just one connection per machine. A single thread to handle all Cassandra requests from all of the worker processes in a machine. CC does this in less than 1 millisecond (usually much less) of time added to the database request and response.

Reducing the connections meant that restarting twenty nodes cost us twenty disconnects and twenty connects, instead of several hundred. Cassandra clusters are no longer suffering from crippling stress whenever a configuration file changes and the cluster requires a restart. The amount of existing connections dropped by more than 80% - which lead to better performance both in connectivity and queries run time. Most importantly, our DBAs were finally happy.

The graph above tracks database and CC connections from one of our production clusters - CC value shown where every client in the graph used to be a database connection.

## Peek Behind the Curtain
Cassandra Communicator adds great value to our machines, and relies on a couple of mechanics: Epoll and the Cassandra C driver.

### Epoll - Unix Magic
Epoll is a kernel-level function tracks and reacts to kernel-level events. Epoll can track as many sockets, pipes etc. as you will ever want. You just bind a callback function to an event, sit back, relax and watch the show. Unlike its predecessors (poll and select) it does not require iterating over every watched socket or pipe (which means it runs in O(N) - that does not scale well) it knows which event was fired without going over the entire list (which runs in O(1)). I used it in CC to watch not only multiple sockets but also a pipe that I added to track responses from Cassandra. There is much that you can do with this nifty kernel function - I might do so in future posts.

### A sync? No thanks, I already ate
Cassandra's C driver is asynchronous in nature - the responses to every command you send can be "collected" later on. We never really used the asynchronous advantage in our code - the C to Lua driver wrapper we use will wait for a response from Cassandra (you can never trust developers to clean up after themselves...) making our calls to Cassandra synchronous as they can be. Contrary to this careful approach, the updated wrapper we used in CC allows us to control everything Cassandra related that was sprawled across our code base and move it to a centralized spot - meaning we do not have to trust developers with this power. Moreover, asynchronous requests allows us time to handle other requests - which in turn allows us to run CC in a single thread.

But wait, who is listening on the socket to and from Cassandra? Well... CC is single threaded only in the sense we never added another thread in our code; however the Cassandra C driver loves some extra threads. Usually there is at least one thread per Cassandra node in the cluster. These listen on the sockets for data from Cassandra. We cannot respond directly from the driver thread due to how Lua environments work, so when a response is received the callback running in the thread writes a single byte to a pipe that triggers the CC process to collect the data. Epoll supports all of this out-of-the-box.

Another advantage to controlling everything Cassandra related inside CC are things such as the prepared statement mechanism. Creating a prepared statement saves a query on the Cassandra side - preparing the query to run more efficiently, assuming it will run more than once. These improve Cassandra performance and is almost mandatory when running in a large scale - however - creating and reusing these statements caused a massive spaghetti situation across our application code in multiple features. There might be a dozen different places that cache these statements on the application side. Having a mechanism to control it in a separate process allows us to clean much of our code. I decided to push this into CC - even though it was not a part of the task, assuming nobody would object.

Cassandra is full of these tiny mechanisms - prepared statements, consistency levels, retry policies, speculative execution etc. It makes little sense to have them sprawled across our code base if they can be handled in a single location that can make decisions based on some compact, centralized logic. CC allows us to have it in a single location.

## There is no place like 127.0.0.1
Every machine in the cluster has its own CC process these days (inside the same machine as the application) which improves latency immensely, makes sense for thread scheduling, and does not affect one worker more or less. It makes sense that each machine has its own connection to the database, similar to what you would have if the all the workers would use the same Cassandra connection.

But can we get even more performance?

## Optimization Prime
Optimizations are a tricky thing. You can almost always optimize more. Will it be worth it to invest more time and effort, to introduce more dependencies or limitations? When Cassandra was first introduced to our application the multiple connections issue was known, but it was deferred to somebody in the future. It was not worth it at the time. As with any project, sometimes you just have to stop when things are working great and you are ready to go, even when there is an obvious fault that will not scale well.

![Application response time before and after Communicator. Percentage of requests with response time over 0.5 second drops from 15% to 2% with Communicator](https://moo64c.github.io/assets/images/2021-07-31-Cassandra-A%20Scale-y%20Story_3.png)

CC runs great in production - the database graphs became pretty when it launched - pretty enough for the head of R&D to display in the quarterly company talk. I speculate we managed to get about 80% of the performance there was to gain by creating it. But what about the other possible 20% optimization, just sitting there all forgotten?

Well, it is a matter of balance.

What we have left to gain here is by further reducing stress on the Cassandra side will probably come with a performance cost to the application side - such as moving CC out of the machines themselves to separate machines, maybe one or two per cluster. You might have a single database connection for a dozen machines! On one side, less connections to the database itself; on the other side - the application will have to jump through more hoops to send requests and receive responses, making that "less than 1 millisecond" baseline a thing of the past. We halted current CC optimizations without taking it out of the application machines, although it was in the original design (and that is why we used TCP sockets and not Unix sockets).

Since application machines are usually much much cheaper than database capacity and we have some extra milliseconds to spend in our SLA, it is likely it will be more economical to move CC out of the application machines. Since bottom line affects many decisions in a business environment, I believe it will happen.

I guess somebody in the *future* will have to do that.

Thanks for reading!
