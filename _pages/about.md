## About Me
Hi! I'm Amir.

I write code, write about code, and take pictures of birds.

Currently, I work at [IBM Trusteer](https://www.ibm.com/trusteer) as a Tech Lead in the [Pinpoint](https://www.ibm.com/products/trusteer-pinpoint-detect) development group.

## About The Blog
[_arbel.dev_](https://arbel.dev) is my personal blog where I share nifty software engineering challenges and how I handled them, along with some more generic technical knowledge. This blog is an outlet for my passion about creating high-quality software; from code readability through designing features to architecture.

Software is details - and I try to provide interesting nuggets of those details in my posts, while keeping them enjoyable for a larger audience.
