## About Me

Hi! I'm Amir.

I write code, write about code, and take pictures of birds. 

Currently, I work at [IBM Trusteer](https://www.ibm.com/trusteer) as a Senior Software Engineer.

## About The Blog
Regularly Irrelevant is my personal blog where I share nifty software engineering challenges and how I handled them. This blog is an outlet for my passion about creating high-quality software; from code readability through designing features to architecture.

Software is details - and I try to provide interesting nuggets of those details in my posts.

Hope you enjoy!
