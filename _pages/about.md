## About Me

Hi! I'm Amir.
I write code, write about code, and take pictures of birds.

Regularly Irrelevant is my personal blog to share nifty software engineering challenges and how I handled them.

## Technical Information
This website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and uses the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).

The site is hosted by [GitHub pages](github.io).

The repository for the site is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/moo64c/moo64c.github.com).
